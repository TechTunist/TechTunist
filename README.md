<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Matt</h1>
<h3 align="center">What if the kid who recursively asked "why?" actually had a point?</h3>

We stand on the shoulders of giants, often with no idea how we got here or what constitutes the foundations beneath our feet. Then we try to build new structures reaching further into the clouds.
The trouble is, when we want to understand the immediate structures on which we build, the levels of abstraction are already so great from the fundamental beginnings that peeling back only on layer is akin to opening up somebody's unfinished novel and attempting to further the plot and character development in a cohesive way by only reading the previous couple of pages. 

Hardly anyone, myself included, gets excited as a noob about writing their first program and immediatley digs into transistors, logic gates, processor architecture, memory allocation etc. In fact, there are any software engineers who are very successful in what they do who have no interest or apparent need to understand the bits and bytes of programming. However there are some, myself included who really struggle to learn and implement new things without understand why I am doing them, or why it is done this way.

I feel like it is time to attempt to answer the question, "why".
